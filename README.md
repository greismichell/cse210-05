## Porpuse
---
Develop and demostrate the mastery of the:
- Design software using the principales of programing with classes (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism)
  - Design a program using the principle of polymorphism.

## Game Specification
---
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

 ### Cycle Rules
 
   Cycle is played according to the following rules:

   * Players can move up, down, left and right...
       * Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
       * Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.

   * Each player's trail grows as they move.
   * Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
   * If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
       * A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
       * The cycles turn white.
       * Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.


## Game Design
---
```

    Behaviors:
    - Create a new match game using the keyboard and video services, and optain the score.

    State: 

    - Start_game:  Starts the game using the given cast. Runs the main game loop.
    - execute_actions: Calls execute for each action in the given group.


* Object: Actor:
    "A visible, moveable thing that participates in the game."

    Responsibility:  
    - Keep track of its appearance, position and velocity in 2d space, and its value.

    Behavior: 
    - Construct news artifacts.

* Object: Action: 
    "A thing that is done."
     
    Responsibility:
    - The responsibility of action is to do somthing that is integral or important in the game. Thus, it has one method, execute(), which should be overridden by derived classes.

```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```
